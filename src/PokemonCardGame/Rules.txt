Attacking
make one attack if you have the energy requirement (there are neutral types which can be filled by any type)
do not discard energy on attack unless specified, attack is then dished to opposing pokemon
when hp <= 0 it goes to the discard pile and it gets replaced by one from the bench (if unable they lose the game)

conditions fade, but damage and energy stay
